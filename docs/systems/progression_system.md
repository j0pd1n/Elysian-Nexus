## Implementation

### Configuration Example
```json
{
    "stat_progression": {
        "points_per_level": 5,
        "max_stat_value": 100,
        "stat_scaling": {
            "strength": {
                "physical_power_multiplier": 1.5
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Code Structure
```python
class ProgressionSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.level = 1
        self.experience = 0
        self.stats = {}
        self.masteries = {}
        
    def gain_experience(self, amount):
        # Handle experience gain and leveling
        pass
        
    def allocate_stat_point(self, stat):
        # Handle stat allocation
        pass
```
