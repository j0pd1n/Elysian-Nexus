This system features several core attributes that define a character‚Äôs capabilities in combat, exploration, and interactions. Each attribute influences specific stats, allowing players to build characters suited to their preferred playstyle.

    Vigor ü©∏
        Primary Role: Increases health (HP) and resistance to certain status effects like fire and poison.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Vital for survivability.
            Higher Vigor means a character can withstand more hits from enemies.

    Mind üåÄ
        Primary Role: Governs Focus Points (FP), which are used for magic, skills, and summons.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Essential for magic-based builds and players who rely on summoning spirits or using special weapon skills frequently.

    Endurance üõ°Ô∏è
        Primary Role: Increases stamina, equip load, and resistance to certain status effects.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Higher stamina allows for more actions in combat, such as dodging, blocking, and attacking.
            Increases the maximum weight a character can carry, enabling the use of heavier armor and weapons without penalty.

    Strength üí™
        Primary Role: Governs the use of heavy, strength-based weapons and contributes to melee damage.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Strength-based weapons, such as greatswords, hammers, and axes, require high Strength to wield.
            Higher Strength increases the scaling damage of weapons suited for brute force.

        Impact on Gameplay:
            Dexterity-based weapons, such as katanas, daggers, and bows, require high Dexterity.
            Reduces fall damage and influences how quickly players can recover from falls.

    Intelligence üß†
        Primary Role: Governs the use of sorcery spells and magic damage scaling.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Vital for sorcery-focused builds.
            Higher Intelligence increases the effectiveness of magic spells and weapons with Intelligence scaling.

    Faith üôè
        Primary Role: Governs the use of incantations and certain buffs/healing abilities.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Vital for faith-based builds focusing on healing, buffs, or holy damage.

        Primary Role: Governs discovery (item drop rate), certain status effects, and some unique spells and incantations.
        Impact on Gameplay:
            Influences the buildup of status effects like bleed or poison on certain weapons.
            Useful for farming rare items and for builds focused on niche magic or weapon effects.

Leveling Up

    Attribute Allocation:
        Players can allocate points to any of the attributes when leveling up.
        Each point increases the chosen attribute's associated stats, such as HP, stamina, or weapon scaling.

Scaling and Weapon Requirements

    Weapon Requirements:
        Many weapons have minimum attribute requirements (e.g., 20 Strength, 15 Dexterity) to wield effectively.
        If a character lacks the required attributes, they can‚Äôt use the weapon properly.

    Scaling:
        Weapons and spells scale their damage based on specific attributes.
        Scaling is denoted by a grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, E) that indicates how well an attribute boosts the weapon's damage.

Status Effects and Resistances

Certain attributes also contribute to resistance against status effects like:

    Poison: Resistance tied to Vigor.
    Frostbite: Resistance tied to Endurance.
    Madness: Resistance tied to Mind.
    Bleed: Resistance tied to specific gear and Arcane.

Playstyles and Builds

The flexibility of Elden Ring's attribute system allows players to create diverse builds, such as:

    Strength Build:
        High Strength for heavy weapons and armor.
        Focus on raw melee damage and survivability.
    Dexterity Build:
        High Dexterity for fast weapons and mobility.
        Suitable for hit-and-run tactics and ranged combat.
    Magic Build:
        High Intelligence or Faith for spellcasting.
        Focus on ranged combat and status effect manipulation.
    Hybrid Build:
        Combining attributes like Strength and Intelligence for spellblade builds.
        Allows versatile playstyles with both melee and magic.

Core Design Principles

    Player Choice:
        Attributes are flexible, letting players create unique characters tailored to their playstyle.

    Strategic Progression:
        Deciding where to invest runes is critical, as each point can significantly impact gameplay.

    Synergy Between Stats:
        Attributes often complement each other (e.g., Strength and Endurance for tank builds).

    Replayability:
        Attribute-focused builds encourage multiple playthroughs, each with a different approach to combat and exploration.
