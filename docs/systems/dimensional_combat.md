# Dimensional Combat System

The Dimensional Combat System is a core feature of Elysian Nexus that allows players to battle across different planes of reality, each with unique properties and strategic implications.

## Overview

The system enables players to:
- Switch between different dimensional planes during combat
- Utilize dimension-specific abilities and effects
- Master dimensional combat techniques
- Combine effects from multiple dimensions

## Dimensions

### Physical Realm
- Base dimension with balanced attributes
- No energy cost for maintaining presence
- Standard combat mechanics apply

### Ethereal Plane
- Increased damage but reduced defense
- Enhanced healing capabilities
- Moderate energy cost to maintain
- Ideal for hit-and-run tactics

### Void Dimension
- Highest damage potential
- Significantly reduced defense
- Limited healing capabilities
- High energy cost to maintain
- High-risk, high-reward gameplay

### Celestial Realm
- Balanced damage increase
- Enhanced defense
- Superior healing capabilities
- Moderate-high energy cost
- Tactical advantage in prolonged fights

## Mechanics

### Dimensional Shifting
1. **Transition Effects**
   - Brief animation period (0.5s)
   - Temporary invulnerability
   - Movement speed reduction
   - Energy cost on shift

2. **Energy Management**
   - Each dimension has maintenance cost
   - Energy regenerates in Physical Realm
   - Strategic shifting required for efficiency

### Combat Modifiers

1. **Dimension Synergy**
   - Bonus effects for matching dimensional attunement
   - Enhanced ability effects in preferred dimensions
   - Mastery bonuses per dimension

2. **Stability Effects**
   - Affects damage variance
   - Influences critical hit chances
   - Modifies resource costs

### Advanced Techniques

1. **Cross-Dimensional Combos**
   - Chain abilities across dimensions
   - Increased damage multipliers
   - Higher energy costs
   - Limited combo duration

2. **Dimensional Mastery**
   - Level-based improvements
   - Reduced energy costs
   - Enhanced stability control
   - Increased damage potential

## Implementation

### Configuration
```json
{
    "dimensions": {
        "physical": {
            "stability": 1.0,
            "energy_cost": 0
        },
        "ethereal": {
            "stability": 0.8,
            "energy_cost": 25
        }
        // ... other dimensions
    }
}
```

### Code Structure
```python
class DimensionalCombat:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_dimension = "physical"
        self.energy = 100.0
        self.stability = 1.0

    def shift_dimension(self, target_dimension):
        # Implement dimension shifting logic
        pass

    def apply_dimensional_effects(self, ability):
        # Apply dimension-specific modifiers
        pass
```

## Best Practices

1. **Energy Management**
   - Monitor energy levels
   - Plan dimensional shifts
   - Utilize Physical Realm for regeneration

2. **Combat Strategy**
   - Match dimensions to playstyle
   - Combine dimensional effects
   - Master dimensional transitions

3. **Ability Usage**
   - Consider dimensional synergies
   - Plan combo sequences
   - Balance energy consumption

## Integration

1. **With Character System**
   - Dimensional attunement stats
   - Mastery progression
   - Ability modifications

2. **With UI System**
   - Dimension indicator
   - Energy meter
   - Stability display
   - Effect visualizations

3. **With World System**
   - Environmental interactions
   - Dimensional rifts
   - Stability zones

## Future Enhancements

1. **Planned Features**
   - New dimensions
   - Advanced combo system
   - Dimensional events
   - Enhanced visual effects

2. **Balance Considerations**
   - Energy cost adjustments
   - Damage scaling
   - Stability effects
   - Combo limitations
