    privileges: Dict[str, any]
    special_abilities: Dict[str, any]
```

#### Faction Alignment System
```python
@dataclass
class FactionAlignment:
    primary: FactionType
    secondary: Optional[FactionType]
    affinity: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    reputation: float  # -1.0 to 1.0
    influence: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
```
