## Technical Implementation

### Combat State Management
```python
class CombatState:
    """Manages the current state of combat"""
    def __init__(self):
        self.phase: CombatPhase
        self.participants: List[Entity]
        self.terrain: Dict[Tuple, TerrainType]
        self.effects: List[CombatEffect]
```

### Combat Calculations
1. **Damage Calculation**
   - Base damage computation
   - Modifier application
   - Resistance calculation
   - Critical hit processing

2. **Healing System**
   - Base healing values
   - Healing modifiers
   - Over-time effects
   - Resistance factors

## Integration Points
- Enemy System: Enemy behavior and stats
- Player System: Player abilities and stats
- Terrain System: Environmental effects
- Inventory System: Combat items and drops
- Quest System: Combat objectives

## Best Practices
1. Always validate movement before execution
2. Consider terrain effects in damage calculations
3. Log important combat events for analysis
4. Handle dimensional transitions carefully
5. Balance dynamic difficulty adjustments
6. Maintain combat state consistency
