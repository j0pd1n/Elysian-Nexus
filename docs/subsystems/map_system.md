## Technical Implementation

### Location Management
```python
@dataclass
class Location:
    name: str
    position: Tuple[int, int]
    location_type: LocationType
    terrain_type: TerrainType
    description: str
    icon: str
    discovered: bool = False
    fast_travel_unlocked: bool = False
    quests: List[str] = None
    resources: List[str] = None
    danger_level: int = 0
    weather_effects: List[str] = None
```

### Path System
```python
class Path:
    def __init__(self, start: Location, end: Location, terrain_type: TerrainType):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
        self.terrain_type = terrain_type
        self.discovered = False
        self.distance = self._calculate_distance()
```
