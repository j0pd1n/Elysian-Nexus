# Dynamic Quest Generation System Documentation

## Overview
The Dynamic Quest Generation System in Elysian Nexus creates procedurally generated quests based on world state, events, and player actions. This system integrates with the world state, faction systems, and environmental conditions to create meaningful and contextual quest content.

## Core Components

### Event Categories
```python
class EventCategory(Enum):
    NATURAL = "natural"
    ECONOMIC = "economic"
    SOCIAL = "social"
    POLITICAL = "political"
    MILITARY = "military"
    SUPERNATURAL = "supernatural"
```

### Event Severity
```python
class EventSeverity(Enum):
    MINOR = "minor"
    MODERATE = "moderate"
    MAJOR = "major"
    CRITICAL = "critical"
    CATASTROPHIC = "catastrophic"
```

### World State Metrics
```python
class WorldStateMetric(Enum):
    STABILITY = "stability"
    PROSPERITY = "prosperity"
    DANGER_LEVEL = "danger_level"
    MORALE = "morale"
    CORRUPTION = "corruption"
    MAGIC_SATURATION = "magic_saturation"
```
