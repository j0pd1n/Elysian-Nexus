# Transportation System Documentation

## Overview
The Transportation system manages all aspects of player movement and travel, including mounts, portals, fast travel, and vehicles while providing seamless world traversal and meaningful travel experiences.

## Core Systems

### Transport Architecture
- **Travel Types**
  - Mount riding
  - Portal networks
  - Fast travel points
  - Vehicle operation
  - Dimensional gates

### Transport Structure
```python
transport_data = {
    'mounts': {
        'active': current_mount,
        'available': owned_mounts,
        'stats': mount_attributes,
        'customization': mount_appearance,
        'abilities': mount_skills
    },
    'fast_travel': {
        'points': discovered_locations,
        'cooldowns': travel_timers,
        'costs': travel_expenses,
        'restrictions': travel_limits,
        'favorites': preferred_points
    },
    'vehicles': {
        'type': vehicle_class,
        'status': vehicle_condition,
        'fuel': energy_level,
        'upgrades': installed_mods,
        'cargo': storage_space
    }
}
```
