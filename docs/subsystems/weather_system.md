## Technical Implementation

### Weather State
```python
@dataclass
class WeatherState:
    weather_type: WeatherType
    intensity: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    temperature: float  # in Celsius
    humidity: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    wind_speed: float  # in m/s
    visibility: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    active_effects: List[EnvironmentalEffect]
    duration: float  # in seconds
    start_time: float
```

### Celestial Pattern
```python
@dataclass
class CelestialPattern:
    alignment: CelestialAlignment
    intensity: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    duration: float  # in seconds
    effects: List[EnvironmentalEffect]
    modifiers: Dict[str, float]
```

### Magical Storm
```python
@dataclass
class MagicalStorm:
    storm_type: WeatherType
    power_level: float  # 0.0 to 1.0
    radius: float  # Area of effect
    duration: float  # in seconds
    effects: List[EnvironmentalEffect]
    damage_types: List[str]
```
