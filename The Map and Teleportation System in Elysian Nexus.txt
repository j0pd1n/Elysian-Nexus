The Map and Teleportation System in Elysian Nexus is a dynamic, text-based grid system that provides players with the ability to navigate the world, view different locations, and use fast travel to move between areas. The system is designed to offer an interactive map with grid coordinates, icon-based representations of different locations, and descriptions of areas based on player exploration and interaction.
Key Features:

    Grid-Based Layout:
        The map is divided into a grid of cells, each representing a specific location or area.
        Each cell is labeled with grid coordinates such as {A1}, {B2}, etc., making it easy for players to reference their current position.
        The grid can expand as players progress, with an initial size of 9x9 and potential expansions up to 30x30 or beyond, based on gameplay needs.

    Location Icons:
        Each cell in the map contains an icon representing the type of location or feature in that area. Icons like üå≤, üè∞, üèôÔ∏è, üõñ, üíÄ, etc., correspond to different environments, structures, or hazards (e.g., forests, castles, cities, dangerous areas).
        These icons provide a quick visual reference for the player and enhance the immersive experience.

    Interactive Map View:
        Players can view their immediate surroundings, typically within a 9x9 grid, but may unlock more of the world as they progress, revealing more cells and new locations.
        As players move around the map, their location is updated, and they are shown the name and description of the area they are entering or leaving.
        The map may also highlight key landmarks and hidden areas, enabling players to discover new locations and explore more in-depth.

    Teleportation / Fast Travel:
        Players can use the teleportation system to fast-travel between unlocked locations. This system works by selecting known locations from the map, saving time and improving gameplay efficiency.
        Teleportation allows for faster movement across the world, encouraging exploration while also reducing time spent on repetitive travel.

    Dynamic Map Changes:
        The map's structure can be updated in real-time based on player actions, quests, or story progress. Locations might change, unlock new areas, or even become inaccessible due to in-game events.
        Hidden or secret locations may be revealed depending on the player's interactions with the world, adding an element of discovery.

    Player Feedback on Movement:
        As players move through the map, their current location (e.g., A1, B2) is displayed. The system provides real-time feedback, so players are always aware of where they are in the world.
        Additionally, players will be informed about the area they are entering or leaving, providing context about that region‚Äôs importance, dangers, or features.

    World Expansion:
        The map system is expandable beyond the initial 9x9 grid, allowing for vast, open-world exploration. As players unlock new regions or gain access to new map sections, the grid grows larger and offers more areas to explore.
        Players may uncover new cities, towns, dungeons, hidden pathways, and other locations that expand the scope of the adventure.

    Descriptive Text:
        Each grid location has a corresponding description to enrich the narrative. Locations like cities, castles, campsites, forests, and dangerous areas each have unique text descriptions that detail what the player sees, hears, or feels upon arrival. This adds to the immersion and storytelling within the game world.

Example of In-Game Map Interaction:

When a player enters a new grid location, they might see something like this:

You are now at {A1} - [üå≤]
You see a dense forest surrounding you. The air is thick with the scent of pine and the sounds of birds chirping.

As the player moves, they would receive similar updates with information about the locations they encounter.

The Map and Teleportation System is a core feature of Elysian Nexus that balances exploration, interaction, and navigation in an expansive text-based environment. It allows players to feel like they are truly traversing a world filled with diverse environments and places to discover.
