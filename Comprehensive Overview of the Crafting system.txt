Comprehensive Overview of the Crafting System in Elysian Nexus

The crafting system in Elysian Nexus is designed to be intuitive, streamlined, and deeply tied to a player’s inventory, progression, and exploration within the game. Players gather materials from various activities (e.g., mining, harvesting, quests) and combine them to create a vast range of items, from weapons and armor to potions and artifacts. The system is designed to support both exploration and creativity, with flexibility for customization in future updates.
Core Features

    Crafting Categories:
        Weapons 🗡️: Create melee and ranged weapons using resources like ores, woods, and mystical crystals.
        Armor 🛡️: Craft defensive gear, including armor sets, helmets, gloves, and boots, with a focus on protection and durability.
        Consumables 🍞: Mix herbs, water, and other natural ingredients to create healing potions, mana potions, and other beneficial items.
        Artifacts ⚙️: Combine rare materials, crystals, and enchanted items to forge powerful artifacts that offer unique abilities or enhancements.

    Crafting Process:
        Material-Based Crafting: Each crafted item requires specific materials. For instance, a "Fire Bow" requires Fire Crystals, Wood, and Leather. A successful craft consumes the materials and yields the crafted item.
        100% Success Rate: The crafting system guarantees 100% success, making it an efficient and player-friendly experience.
        Inventory-Based Crafting: Only items that are available in the player’s inventory can be crafted. The system automatically checks for the required resources.
        Item Recipes: Recipes for crafting are either provided by the game world or unlocked through progression. These recipes provide detailed lists of materials needed for each item.

    Craftable Items:
        Items that can be crafted are dynamically updated based on the player’s inventory, level, and progression.
        Recipes are unlocked progressively as players gain more experience and resources.

    Submenus:
        The crafting menu presents options for each crafting category. When the player selects a category, they are shown the list of craftable items in that category, along with the quantities that can be made based on the current inventory.
