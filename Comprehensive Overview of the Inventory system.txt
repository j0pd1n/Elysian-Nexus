Comprehensive Overview of the Inventory System

The Inventory System in Elysian Nexus is designed to manage, categorize, and display the player’s items, both equipped and stored. It is a visual tool that organizes items into categories, provides easy navigation, and offers options for interacting with items. This system allows players to view, equip, unequip, and manage their items while ensuring a clean, organized interface that handles large quantities of items efficiently.
Key Features:

    Categories: Items are grouped into categories for better organization. Each category is represented by an icon and includes an item count. The categories include:
        Weapons 🗡️
        Armor 🛡️
        Consumables 🍞
        Materials ⚒️
        Quest Items 🔮
        Artifacts 💍
        Miscellaneous 🎲

    Equipped Items: The system tracks the player's equipped gear, such as weapons, armor, and accessories. Equipped items are shown at the top of the inventory screen, with the item name and the associated equipment slot (Main Hand, Offhand, etc.).

    Item IDs: Every item in the inventory is uniquely identified by an internal Item ID, though this information is not displayed to the player. This ensures that the system can track and reference items consistently.

    Item Interactions:
        Equip/Unequip: Players can equip or unequip items, such as switching weapons or armor. This can be done by selecting the item in the inventory and choosing the “Equip/Unequip” option.
        Expand Item Information: Players can view detailed information about any item, such as its effects, damage, durability, or any other stats, through the “Expand Item Information” option.

    Icons and Visual Layout: The inventory is designed with visual ease in mind. It uses icons to represent each category, making it quick to identify the type of items in each section. The inventory also uses a grid-based layout to display items efficiently.

    Notifications: The system includes a notification feature that informs the player of any changes made to the inventory, such as using potions, obtaining new items, or equipping new gear. These notifications keep the player informed and immersed.

    Actions: The player has access to several actions that are visually represented in the menu. These actions include viewing categories of items, expanding item details, and equipping or unequipping gear.

    Inventory Limits: The inventory can hold a large number of items, and the categories are designed to efficiently sort and display them. The system is optimized to handle large inventories with ease.
