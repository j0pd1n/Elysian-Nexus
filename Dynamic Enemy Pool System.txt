if "fire_damage_taken" > 50% and not self.has_trait("FireResistant"):
    self.add_trait("FireResistant")
    self.increase_stat("Speed", value=10)

2. Scaling Enemy Resources

Energy or Mana Pools:

Enemies use resource pools to manage abilities.

Stronger enemies recharge faster or absorb energy from the environment.

class Enemy:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mana = 100
    def cast_spell(self, spell_cost):
        if self.mana >= spell_cost:
            self.mana -= spell_cost
            return True
        else:
            self.recover_mana()
            return False
    def recover_mana(self):
        self.mana += 10

Summoning Pools:

Certain enemies summon reinforcements with scaling strength and quantity.

Example:

Early game: Summons 2 basic minions.

Late game: Summons 5 elite minions.

3. Reward System Based on Difficulty

Scaling Rewards:

Rewards include gold, crafting materials, or unique gear.

Higher-difficulty enemies drop rarer items or lore pieces.

def generate_loot(enemy_difficulty):
    loot_table = {
        "Easy": ["Gold", "Potion"],
        "Medium": ["Rare Material", "Magic Weapon"],
        "Hard": ["Epic Gear", "Special Artifact"],
        "Legendary": ["Legendary Item", "Unique Lore"]
    }
    return random.choice(loot_table[enemy_difficulty])

Reputation Impact:

Player reputation improves with factions for defeating specific enemies.

4. Unique Boss Encounters

Scaling Boss Fights:

Boss abilities scale based on environment, player health, or strategy.

Example: A forest boss summons nature minions at night and gains health with larger player groups.

Adaptive Phases:

Bosses change tactics mid-battle based on player actions.

Example: If players rely on ranged attacks, the boss gains reflective shields or closes distances aggressively.

if "ranged_damage_taken" > 50%:
    self.add_ability("Reflective Shield")
    self.activate_phase("CloseCombat")
